### Meet the Search Command

```text
Going to Union Station takes time,
but this time can be an advantage.
Use it right, and travelling time
will pay off.
```

`/time` - search for time forward  
`?time` - search for time backwards  
`n` - go to the next result  
`N` - go to the previous result - it always goes in the opposite direction  
`/<CR>` - will execute the last search forward  
`?<CR>` - will execute the last search backwards  

Use the "Up" button to browse search history.
