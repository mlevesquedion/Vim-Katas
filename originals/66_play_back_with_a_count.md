### Play Back with a Count

Make this text:

```javascript
var x = "("+a+","+b+","+c+","+d+","+e+")";
```

Look like this:

```javascript
var x = "(" + a + "," + b + "," + c + "," + d + "," + e + ")";
```

`f+` - find the first "+"  
`s<Space>+<Space><Esc>` - add spaces around "+"  
`qq;.q` - record the `;.` keystrokes in the q register  
`22@q` - run the macro 22 times, it's OK to run it more
