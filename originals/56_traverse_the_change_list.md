### Traverse the change list

`:changes` -  will list all the changes during an editing session

`g;` - traverse backward the changelist  
`g,` - traverse forward the changelist  

`backtic .` - moves you to the last change  
`backtic ^` - moves you to the last insertion  
`gi` - live insert mode, move around, this takes you back to insert mode where I left off
